This is the source code to my web page: AJLeonardi.co

I'll be using this page to help myself get more familiar with web development, git, etc.

Current Features:
- IE specific message
- in chrome, safari, firefox? background image is "cover"
- reference Gravatar image so I only need to change my photo in one place
- Twitter feed shown within my site
- blog shown within my site (two entries)
- gitHub shown within my site


Future changes:
- the "links" list look like crap, and makes the content DIV look unbalanced -- I'll need a better design for this
- get background img to scale correctly in IE
- find a good image for my blog
- Show LinkedIn within my site (requires OAuth)
- fix so that the "close" icon is displayed on top of the feed's header.
- load twitter/blog etc on click -- not on doc load...currently it takes too long, and the links take you to the actual page if clicked before page finished loading (which is ok, but not ideal).
- Cleanup/Consolidate CSS
- Consolidate JS Callbacks
