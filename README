This is the source code to my web page: AJLeonardi.co

I'll be using this page to help myself get more familiar with web development, git, etc.

Current Features:
- IE specific message
- floating div which moves around etc when resizing the window -- so shouldn't look like total crap
- in chrome, safari, firefox? background image is "cover"

Future changes:
- reference Gravatar image so I only need to change my photo in one place
- the "links" list look like crap, and makes the content DIV look unbalanced -- I'll need a better design for this
- get shadows working in IE
- get background img to scale correctly in IE
- Create dynamic divs which display my twitter/linkedIn/etc on the left side on hover
