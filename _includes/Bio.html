            <h2>Anthony Leonardi</h2>
            <p>After graduating from <a target='_blank' href='http://www.umass.edu/'>UMass - Amherst</a> with degrees in both Computer Science and Mathematics, I joined <a target='_blank' href='http://www.pega.com/'>Pegasystems</a> as a Sales Engineer. Since then I've rapidly developed my consulting, product, and leadership skills while helping customers on 3 different continents and leading teams on 4.</p>
            <p>Outside work I try to concentrate my spare time on personal development. Typically that means <a target="_blank" href='http://travel.ajleonardi.co'>traveling</a> with my wife Lucia, working on side projects, and just reading -- novels, tech blogs, or business and mgmt books.</p>
            <p>Have a look around this page and the linked sites to get a sense for who I am. If you want to chat, please feel free to <a href='#Contact'>contact me</a>.</p>
